Use HC-05 Controller to add to your existing code!

You will see the BOT code, but you do not need it as it will already be on the Zumo Bot. 

Use the Menu for any additional inputs you'd like the to add.
This menu will be on the Zumo so all you will need to do is send the letter of what you'd like to use.
